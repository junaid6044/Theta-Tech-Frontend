# Git Workflow

## Create and Switch to a Feature Branch

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already).
2. Create a new feature branch and switch to it:

   ```git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name```

3. ## Check your current branch
    ```git branch ```

4. ## Check the status of your working directory
git status

5. ## Add your files
    ```git add .```

6. ## Commit your files
    ```git commit -m "Your commit message"```

7. ## Pull the latest changes from the 'dev' branch
    ```git pull origin dev```

8. ## Push your feature branch to the remote repository
    ```git push origin feature/<your-branch>```
